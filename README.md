# ✨Simple-Sniffer✨

## 📎Subject: Programming for Penetration Testing

### 📖Backstory
Our lecturer asked us to build a sniffer that able to listen to every communication that's been made on the computer. Since this project is a part of a guided self-learning class, I managed to use the provided resources to learn how to build a simple sniffer myself. I know this program is too simple and I'm not quite satisfied with it yet. So, I will actively keep improving and post my updates here!

### 👩‍🏫How to use it
Simply run the proxy server first, and then proceed to quickly run the sniffer program. Then, you can continue to run the client program and monitor the traffic through the sniffer.
+p.s. keep in mind to use terminal/powershell with admin privileges in order to run the sniffer!
